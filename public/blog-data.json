    "content": "<![CDATA[<h1 id=\"heading-what-is-changing\">What is Changing?</h1><p>As AI continues to evolve, its making the process of creating products more accessible than ever. Today, with just an idea and the right tools, anyone can innovate and bring something to life. However, this newfound simplicity is shifting the challenge from <strong>how to create</strong> to <strong>how to acquire and retain customers</strong>. With the market flooded with similar offerings, standing out becomes the ultimate testand <strong>communities</strong> might be the answer.</p><hr /><h2 id=\"heading-why-communities-matter-decentralizing-monopolies-and-power\">Why Communities Matter: Decentralizing Monopolies and Power</h2><h3 id=\"heading-trust-drives-consumer-choices\">Trust Drives Consumer Choices</h3><p>One of the most influential factors in consumer decision-making is <strong>trust</strong>. People dont just buy products; they buy into the individuals and brands behind them. Communities foster this trust through shared values, experiences, and open dialogue. When customers feel connected to a creator or brand, theyre more likely to support itand stay loyal.</p><p>Take the example of <strong>potato chips</strong>:<br />Imagine choosing between five nearly identical brands in a supermarket. Now imagine a friend or community member introduces a healthier, equally tasty, and slightly innovative option. Youd likely pick their productnot just because its better, but because you trust the person behind it. And if the product falls short, youd feel empowered to give honest feedback, knowing it would be acted upon.</p><hr /><h3 id=\"heading-faster-feedback-loops\">Faster Feedback Loops</h3><p>Communities enable creators to receive direct, real-time feedback, unlike traditional businesses relying on slow surveys or impersonal market research. This creates a <strong>fast feedback loop</strong>, allowing products to be continuously refined.</p><p>For instance, if your friends potato chips were too salty, you could immediately let them know. They might tweak the recipe based on your input, improving the product while strengthening your trust in their responsiveness.</p><hr /><h3 id=\"heading-emotional-differentiation\">Emotional Differentiation</h3><p>In an age of commoditization, <strong>products alone wont set businesses apart</strong>. Emotional and social connections created through communities will be the true differentiators. Platforms like <strong>Patreon</strong>, <strong>Substack</strong>, and <strong>Heylo</strong> already show how community-driven models flourish. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for products and services that align with their values and offer a deeper connection.</p><hr /><h2 id=\"heading-applying-nash-equilibrium-to-communities\">Applying Nash Equilibrium to Communities</h2><h3 id=\"heading-removing-abuse-and-power-imbalances\">Removing Abuse and Power Imbalances</h3><p>The <strong>Nash Equilibrium</strong>, a principle from game theory, describes a state where no participant can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy. This concept can apply to communities, ensuring fairness and reducing abuse.</p><h4 id=\"heading-case-study-midnight-runners\">Case Study: Midnight Runners</h4><p>Two years ago, I joined <strong>Midnight Runners Toronto</strong> when it was a small group of 50 runners. Documenting its journey through Instagram reels created <strong>organic virality</strong>, growing its following to over 20,000. However, as it scaled, challenges emerged. Negative behaviors by certain leaders and members began to damage the communitys reputation.</p><h4 id=\"heading-the-hype-squad-effect\">The Hype Squad Effect</h4><p>To counteract these dynamics, I formed the \"Hype Squad,\" a group of 80+ members chosen not by status but by how they treated others. This diverse groupfrom top entrepreneurs to individuals known for kindnesshelped shift the culture. We hosted potlucks, karaoke nights, and genuine celebrations, prioritizing <strong>shared experiences</strong> over hierarchy.</p><hr /><h2 id=\"heading-how-can-creators-leverage-communities\">How Can Creators Leverage Communities?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Start Small, Build Trust</strong>: Foster a tight-knit group of early adopters and engage authentically.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create a Feedback Loop</strong>: Act on feedback to show customers their voices matter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Highlight Shared Values</strong>: Build narratives around shared goals and missions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Measure Loyalty, Not Just Growth</strong>: Focus on retention and satisfaction over numbers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Tools Effectively</strong>: Leverage platforms like <strong>Heylo</strong>, <strong>Patreon</strong>, or <strong>Discord</strong> for engagement and tools like <strong>Hotjar</strong> and <strong>Google Analytics</strong> for product insights.</p></li></ul><hr /><h2 id=\"heading-challenges-of-the-community-first-approach\">Challenges of the Community-First Approach</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Keeping intimacy alive as communities grow is difficult.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transparency</strong>: Higher accountability demands openness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Competition</strong>: Differentiating yourself in a community-driven market requires creativity.</p></li></ul><hr /><h1 id=\"heading-thriving-in-the-age-of-digital-accountability\">Thriving in the Age of Digital Accountability</h1><h3 id=\"heading-key-insight-for-creators-and-future-businesses\">Key Insight for Creators and Future Businesses:</h3><blockquote><p>\"The power of communities lies in trust, collaboration, and distributionnot monopolies.\"</p></blockquote><hr /><h2 id=\"heading-the-role-of-ai-in-accountability\">The Role of AI in Accountability</h2><p>AI acts as both a <strong>tool for creators</strong> and a <strong>watchdog for humanity</strong>. It ensures transparency by sifting through data to surface truths, making it harder for businesses to obscure their actions. This transparency, however, is an opportunity to leverage AI for continuous improvement and stronger relationships.</p><hr /><h2 id=\"heading-conclusion-the-future-is-personal\">Conclusion: The Future is Personal</h2><p>The future belongs to those who embrace community-driven models.

    "content": "<![CDATA[<h1 id=\"heading-introduction-guest-speaking-at-uoft\">Introduction: Guest Speaking at UoFT</h1><p>Recently, I had the privilege of guest-speaking at the University of Toronto, invited by Joseph Jay Williams, to discuss a core component of human-computer interaction (HCI): experimentation and A/B testing. This talk allowed me to share real-world insights from my design journey, focusing on how experimentation drives user-centered, data-driven products. The core principle of design is \"Put yourself into the customer's shoes and see from every angle.\" When I A/B tested this principle itselfacross how design could have been done with other tools and timelinesit revealed itself as a fundamental truth. A/B testing is crucial in design because, so far, only a few designers build from one subject domain perspective due to limited resources. However, in the AI revolution, we will increasingly use generative UI and even generative UX strategies to test from multiple angles, creating more flexible and holistic design solutions. Heres an outline of the session, structured to give students a deeper understanding of design experimentation.</p><h2 id=\"heading-what-the-role-of-ab-testing-and-experimentation-in-hci\">What: The Role of A/B Testing and Experimentation in HCI</h2><p>In the session, I emphasized that every design choice is, in essence, a hypothesis. No matter how well-reasoned, our assumptions need validation through data. This is where A/B testing, experimentation, and metrics come into play.</p><p>A significant takeaway for students was understanding that design is never final. Continuous improvement is possible only by testing, measuring, and iterating.</p><h2 id=\"heading-why-the-importance-of-testing-hypotheses\">Why: The Importance of Testing Hypotheses</h2><p>The key message was that assumptions alone cannot drive successful design; only data and real-world testing can. By treating each design choice as a hypothesis, we can make evidence-based improvements rather than relying solely on intuition.</p><p>For example, in one of my previous startups, I noticed that about 60% of users were accessing the platform on mobile. I used this insight to test a hypothesis based on two core psychological principlesFitts's Law and Hick's Law.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lawsofux.com/\"><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730222994236/49eddc1f-0ef2-424e-aa6f-1f3c06f23b03.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></a></p><h3 id=\"heading-applying-fittss-and-hicks-laws\">Applying Fittss and Hicks Laws</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Fittss Law</strong>: This law posits that the time to reach a target depends on its distance and size, which is crucial for mobile design where users often rely on their thumbs for navigation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hicks Law</strong>: Hick's Law explains that having more choices can slow down decision-making. Simplifying the experience by optimizing button placement can make navigation more intuitive.</p></li></ul><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/the-thumb-zone-designing-for-mobile-users/\"><img src=\"https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/496f7bc0-4c6c-4159-b731-ec3adcf91105/thumb-zone-mapping-opt.png\" alt=\"thumb-zone-mapping-opt.png (957618)\" /></a></p><p>Source: Smashing Magazine</p><p>Hypothesizing that a bottom navigation bar could make key calls-to-action (CTAs) more accessible, I conducted an experiment. With this change, conversions increased by over 20% within two weeks, validating the hypothesis and demonstrating the power of data-driven design.</p><h2 id=\"heading-how-building-and-testing-multiple-hypotheses\">How: Building and Testing Multiple Hypotheses</h2><p>I walked students through actionable steps on developing and testing hypotheses:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Identify Hypotheses</strong>: Every design change should begin with a clear hypothesis. For instance, Placing CTAs within thumb reach on mobile will increase engagement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set Metrics for Success</strong>: Define success metrics, whether its increased conversions, engagement, or specific click-through rates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gather Stakeholder Input</strong>: I involve stakeholders, such as the CMO, CTO, support teams, and customers, to gather varied perspectives on potential pain points. These insights often inspire additional hypotheses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implement and Measure Variations</strong>: After gathering input, I create multiple design variations and test them against the baseline to identify the best-performing version.</p></li></ol><h3 id=\"heading-tools-of-the-trade-research-design-and-project-management\">Tools of the Trade: Research, Design, and Project Management</h3><p>To track, analyze, and bring hypotheses to life, I rely on several tools, each fulfilling a unique role in the design and experimentation workflow:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager</strong>: These tools allow for custom tracking, letting me evaluate detailed engagement metrics for each design element.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hotjar</strong>: For in-depth behavioral research, Hotjar provides user session recordings, heatmaps, and insights like rage clicks, showing where users encounter fr<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/users/karanbalaji/projects/2\">ustr</a>ation or drop off. This enable<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/users/karanbalaji/projects/2\">s me</a> to address issues beyond raw metrics, focusing on actual user behavior and interaction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Figma</strong>: Figma is central to developing design hypotheses<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/users/karanbalaji/projects/2\">, es</a>pecially the visual components. It allows me to experiment visually, crafting multiple iterations before finalizing designs for testing.</p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://V0.dev\"><strong>V0.dev</strong></a>: A re<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/users/karanbalaji/projects/2\">cent</a> addition to my workflow, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://V0.dev\">V0.dev</a> is a prompt-based tool for generating multiple UI designs. This is fantastic for brainstorming, as it helps me quickly explore different UI ideas and variations, making the process of conceptualizing and iterating more efficient.</p></li><li><p><strong>GitHub Issues fo</strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/users/karanbalaji/projects/2\"><strong>r Pr</strong></a><strong>oject Management</strong>: For managing tasks and tracking progress, I use <strong>GitHubs Issues feature</strong>. I create tickets for each design and coding task, organizing them into a structured <strong>Kanban board</strong>. You ca<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/users/karanbalaji/projects/2\">n ch</a>eck out my active board <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/users/karanbalaji/projects/2\">here</a>, where every project phase, from hypothesis to testing, is meticulously documented. This setup is invaluable for transparent project management, allowing me to keep experiments organized and collaborate effectively.</p></li></ul><p>Together, these tools help me <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/users/karanbalaji/projects/2\">cond</a>uct research, design iteratively, and manage projects in a way that is outcome-driven and systematically refined based on data.</p><h2 id=\"heading-inspiring-resource-designing-like-a-scientist\">Inspiring Resource: Designing Like a Scientist</h2><div class=\"embed-wrapper\"><div class=\"embed-loading\"><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div></div><a class=\"embed-card\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRd6Ddn4ZSY&amp;t=480s&amp;ab_channel=awwwards.\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRd6Ddn4ZSY&amp;t=480s&amp;ab_channel=awwwards.</a></div><p> </p><p>In line with the talks themes, I explained the concept to students linked to Navin Iyengar's <strong>Design Like a Scientist</strong> talk from Netflix, recorded on August 10, 2018. Navin explains how Netflix uses outcome-based testing to drive design decisions by experimenting with multiple variat<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/users/karanbalaji/projects/2\">ions</a>. This approach is similar to what I call <strong>conversion-driven design</strong> and aligns with a broader concept called <strong>outcome-driven design</strong>.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRd6Ddn4ZSY&amp;t=480s&amp;ab_channel=awwwards.\"><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730223150815/578f0cc0-0fc1-48ef-b720-80fcbc1b9bc6.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></a></p><p>Even Nielsen Norman Group recently noted on March 22, 2024, that the future of design will blend <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/generative-ui/\"><strong>generative UI</strong> with outcome-driven principles</a>. For my A/B testing and experimentation, I often use tools like <strong>VWO</strong> and previously <strong>Google Optimize</strong> (which has since been sunsetted), which make it easy to implement, measure, and refine designs based on real user data.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/generative-ui/\"><img src=\"https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2024/03/21/genui-personalized-interface-for-each-user-nng.png\" alt=\"Today = the same interface for everyone. Future with GenUI = Personalized interface for each user\" /></a></p><p>This concept of design like a scientist resonated well with the students, inspiring them to adopt a similar experimental mindset.</p><h2 id=\"heading-question-from-guoxiang-zhao-collaboration-after-handoff\">Question from Guoxiang Zhao: Collaboration After Handoff:</h2><div class=\"embed-wrapper\"><div class=\"embed-loading\"><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div></div><a class=\"embed-card\" href=\"https://youtu.be/_R6qo-jTWBI?si=L-ccYUm4YuOUq55X\">https://youtu.be/_R6qo-jTWBI?si=L-ccYUm4YuOUq55X</a></div><p> </p><p>One of the most engaging moments was when a student, Guoxiang Zhao, asked, <em>What do you do once your design work is handed off to the front-end developers? Do you continue refining the UI with them, or move on to the next project?</em></p><p>My answer emphasized the iterative nature of design. Just as we treat initial design choices as hypotheses, we also validate the implemented design. I explained that I actively collaborate with the development team after handoff, measuring the designs effectiveness and refining as needed. Experimentation is continuous, and success is proven only when real users interact with the design, with metrics confirming our goals.</p><h2 id=\"heading-real-world-example-resolving-stakeholder-feedback-through-experimentation\">Real-World Example: Resolving Stakeholder Feedback through Experimentation</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730223674402/320504ae-c5d3-488c-937a-f4663d0f54b8.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>Finally, I discussed how experimentation helps navigate and validate stakeholder feedback. Often, team membersfrom executives to support staffhave diverse perspectives on design changes. By framing each idea as a hypothesis and testing it, I can systematically address everyones input, creating outcome-driven designs that satisfy both stakeholders and users.</p><h2 id=\"heading-conclusion-encouraging-experimentation-beyond-design\">Conclusion: Encouraging Experimentation Beyond Design</h2><p>Speaking with U of T students was an inspiring experience. Their questions and enthusiasm showed a deep interest in exploring psychological and experimental perspectives in design. Through examples like applying Fittss and Hicks Laws, I hope I illustrated that HCI is as much about understanding human behavior as it is about visual design. The students left with a newfound curiosity about testing from multiple angles, and I was reminded that experimentation is truly the key to effective, user-centered design.</p><p>Lets keep iterating and experimenting!</p>]]>"

Ram is the first scientist to use <strong>kTMP</strong>, a new form of continuous magnetic stimulation, and the first to use it outside the company that developed it. His work, combined with the development of a <strong>new neurofeedback technique</strong>, is paving the way for a future where the brain directly interacts with machines in ways that were once the stuff of science fiction.</p><p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeQllV-QTTMkD0KqrxH3eMVQVjK8g2rfs95jIAI7MHWDiYSC26hnwJxvgbqi0klxKlIgAgQoOSVzAzN-t_WZnXCPWN2gMfYUs6Cj7edmiZ9Jn68CNUzgRRAXU_eBd_YQJ40GuN1UP7MK-MlYyI0lHOojB8?key=N6XyH0TkT_EsyIkko3yVGQ\" alt /></p><h2 id=\"heading-what-unveiling-the-mysteries-of-neural-oscillations\"><strong>What: Unveiling the Mysteries of Neural Oscillations</strong></h2><p>At the core of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces is the intricate world of <strong>neural oscillations</strong>the rhythmic patterns that govern cognition, perception, and consciousness. These oscillations, which range from slow delta waves to fast gamma waves, synchronize different regions of the brain, enabling cognitive and sensory functions. Ram explains that one of the features of these oscillations, particularly in perception acts like a natural filter, helping the brain focus on relevant stimuli while ignoring distractions.</p><p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXekKVcDwrF_8-03_tI0FPUnPcbhOiJupcvLYvACnj4FBCFyc_ifQLLL_cnQkfPMBmVIBUudePUddGlSiOR6qHCW0_LxjBzzzHYNU1bZ3ZWnxrj21xgVY5NxJGEhysbcFQC6u5ZpR8F6e8Du_gWQK7iDik4?key=N6XyH0TkT_EsyIkko3yVGQ\" alt /></p><p>Ram's pioneering research focuses on decoding these oscillations through non-invasive methods like <strong>electroencephalography (EEG)</strong>, a technique that measures the brain's electrical activity. This year also marks the <strong>100-year anniversary of EEG</strong>, a landmark tool that has been indispensable in allowing researchers to peer into the brains inner workings without invasive techniques. The centennial of EEG reminds us of its lasting importance, even as new methods like kTMP push the field of modulating these oscillations into exciting new territories.</p><h2 id=\"heading-where-are-we-so-far\"><strong>Where Are We So Far?</strong></h2><p>As we celebrate the <strong>100-year anniversary of EEG</strong>, the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has reached new heights. Ram Kumar Pari's use of <strong>kTMP</strong>, a novel form of magnetic stimulation, marks a significant advancement in how we interact with and modulate brain activity. Ram is the first scientist outside the original company to implement this technique in experiments, contributing to breakthroughs in neural oscillations research.</p><p>However, the <strong>price of high-quality EEG equipment</strong> remains a barrier. <strong>Research-grade devices</strong>, such as Ceegrids, can cost around <strong>$5000</strong> and require extensive research expertise to set up and use effectively. These high-end systems are crucial for fine-tuning brain oscillation measurements, but they are not clinical products. While <strong>commercial versions</strong> with <strong>dry electrodes</strong> are available at a lower price point, they often suffer from signal noise, limiting their effectiveness in precise applications.</p><p>The future holds promise, though, as technological innovation is driving down costs. Ram notes that future devices, which match the capabilities of today's <strong>research-grade equipment</strong>, could be available for significantly lower prices, possibly around <strong>$300</strong>. This drop in cost, combined with improved usability, could democratize access to EEG-based BCIs and bring them into mainstream use for both research and consumer applications.</p><h2 id=\"heading-why-decoding-the-brains-electrical-symphony\"><strong>Why: Decoding the Brain's Electrical Symphony</strong></h2><p>At the core of <strong>non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)</strong> lies the challenge of understanding the brain's complex electrical patterns. The brains oscillations, measured using <strong>electroencephalography (EEG)</strong>, provide a glimpse into how different regions of the brain communicate. However, as <strong>Ram</strong> explains, decoding these signals is far more complex than simply filtering out noise from sound.</p><p>The <strong>noise</strong> in EEG recordings is often <strong>high-dimensional</strong> and <strong>mathematically intricate</strong>, making it difficult to isolate relevant neural oscillations from the surrounding electrical activity. Ram notes that this complexity poses a significant hurdle for researchers, who must use advanced <strong>signal processing</strong> techniques to interpret the data. These techniques don't necessarily solve the noise issue but help study the <strong>modulation of brain oscillations</strong>, providing insights into how they can be influenced.</p><p>One existing method is <strong>transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)</strong>, which uses <strong>electric fields</strong> to modulate brain activity. tACS is well-established and offers a non-invasive way to influence neural oscillations. Although it doesnt directly address the noise problem in EEG, it provides a way to explore how specific oscillations can be targeted and manipulated for therapeutic purposes.</p><h2 id=\"heading-what-will-the-future-be\"><strong>What Will the Future Be?</strong></h2><p>The future of <strong>non-invasive brain-computer interfaces</strong> (BCIs) holds remarkable promise. <strong>Ram Kumar Pari</strong> foresees that devices designed to directly interface with the brain will revolutionize human-computer interaction within the next <strong>5 to 10 years</strong>. This shift, which Ram calls a transition from the <strong>computing revolution</strong> to the <strong>neural revolution</strong>, will dramatically lower the barriers to these technologies.</p><p>Currently, <strong>research-grade devices</strong>, such as <strong>Ceegrids</strong>, are expensive, priced around <strong>$5000</strong>, and require significant expertise to set up. These devices offer high precision for research but come with challenges like <strong>complex noise filtering</strong>. However, commercial solutions, such as <strong>dry electrode</strong> versions, already exist at lower price points but can suffer from <strong>noise issues</strong>. Ram anticipates that future iterations will bring the cost down significantly, potentially as low as <strong>$300</strong> for research-grade capabilities, making them accessible to a much broader audience without compromising quality.</p><p>In addition to cost, Ram reveals a major breakthrough: <strong>non-invasive techniques</strong> that could treat conditions like <strong>epilepsy</strong> before resorting to <strong>invasive surgery</strong> or exhausting <strong>drug options</strong>. Currently, invasive stimulation is the last resort after drugs fail, but with non-invasive BCIs, the treatment could begin <strong>much earlier</strong>, potentially offering the same level of efficacy as drugswithout the associated side effects. This is especially important for patients like <strong>pregnant women</strong>, for whom <strong>drug treatments</strong> can pose serious risks to the fetus. By avoiding harmful side effects, non-invasive solutions could make a profound difference in treating epilepsy safely.</p><p>This non-invasive approach also hints at a broader revolution in <strong>healthcare</strong>, with the potential to reduce reliance on drugs and surgery, shifting treatment towards <strong>brain modulation</strong> techniques that leverage neural oscillations to restore function or alleviate conditions.</p><h2 id=\"heading-how-bridging-the-gap-external-and-internal-approaches\"><strong>How: Bridging the Gap  External and Internal Approaches</strong></h2><p>Researchers are taking two complementary approaches to overcome current challenges in brain-computer interfaces:</p><ul><li><p><strong>External stimulation</strong>: Methods like <strong>kTMP</strong> and <strong>tACS</strong> use alternating electromagnetic fields to influence neural oscillations, allowing researchers to modulate specific brain functions. This approach has the potential to enhance cognitive functions and treat neurological disorders in a non-invasive way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Internal modulation</strong>: Techniques like <strong>neurofeedback</strong> empower individuals to consciously control their brainwaves.

Ram Kumar Pari highlights key areas where this technology could have a significant impact, including <strong>auditory attention</strong>, <strong>language learning</strong>, and more intuitive human-device interaction.</p><h4 id=\"heading-auditory-attention-and-the-cocktail-party-effect\"><strong>Auditory Attention and the \"Cocktail Party Effect\"</strong></h4><p>One of the most compelling applications is addressing auditory attention issues in elderly adults. Ram explains that while older individuals may not suffer from hearing loss per se, they often struggle with whats known as the <strong>\"cocktail party effect\"</strong>. This refers to the brain's ability to filter out irrelevant sounds in noisy environments, like focusing on a single conversation in a crowded room. The difficulty comes from altered neural oscillations that impair the ability to process relevant auditory information. Hearing aids dont address this problem espcially when the physical hearing capabilities arent as affected. It offers a solution to enhance auditory attention by synchronizing neural oscillations with specific auditory stimuli.</p><p>This technology of Neurofeedback, in general has been available for the past 20 years, but Ram emphasizes that the combination of advanced <strong>BCI systems</strong> with standard hearing aids offers a promising avenue for improving auditory attention in the elderly, helping them better filter and focus on relevant sounds and also to age-related hearing loss.</p><h4 id=\"heading-language-learning-and-cognitive-enhancement\"><strong>Language Learning and Cognitive Enhancement</strong></h4><p>In addition to auditory applications, non-invasive BCIs could enhance <strong>language learning</strong> and overall <strong>cognitive processing</strong>. By tapping into the brain's natural neural oscillations, these interfaces can potentially accelerate language acquisition and optimize cognitive functions in healthy individuals. For example, aligning neural oscillations with specific language inputs could improve how quickly and efficiently learners grasp new languages, opening up new pathways for global communication and exchange.</p><h4 id=\"heading-accessibility-direct-interaction-with-devices-from-the-brain\"><strong>Accessibility: Direct Interaction with Devices from the Brain</strong></h4><p>Looking further into the future, Ram envisions a world where individuals with disabilities or cognitive challenges can interact directly with digital devices using only their brain activity. Instead of relying on traditional interfaces like keyboards or touch screens, these users could command their devices by modulating <strong>neural oscillations</strong>, effectively bridging the gap between mind and machine. This development could vastly improve <strong>accessibility</strong> and <strong>independence</strong> for individuals with motor impairments or other conditions that limit physical interaction with technology.</p><p>Through these applications, <strong>non-invasive BCIs</strong> hold the potential to reshape how we engage with both the physical and digital worlds, offering new tools to enhance cognition, learning, and accessibility.</p><h2 id=\"heading-towards-a-future-of-seamless-interaction\"><strong>Towards a Future of Seamless Interaction</strong></h2><p>As foundational research progresses, Ram emphasizes the importance of pushing the field towards <strong>practical applications</strong> and <strong>consumer products</strong>. The modular and flexible nature of brain-computer interfaces allows for cost-effective development, which could lead to the creation of affordable consumer devices in the near future.</p><p>The implications of this technology extend beyond healthcare. BCIs have the potential to revolutionize industries like <strong>pharmaceuticals</strong>, where drug-free treatments for neurological disorders become a reality. In this future, the boundaries between human cognition and digital interfaces blur, enabling a new era of seamless interaction between the brain and the digital world.</p><p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXduaTfZCqJn1zRxn47wpIeu33jABwGUuzSnNY38XQst5PN7a5mnlKCF8fXveRx7Ocp731mRYtwF23n4juPcqf4iAFMdYHqkvTrUlnp7xdXRA6ZGVjySqvt6SKKJr6VWt-ruA-9xlAtFSkiJk22z_0A431ql?key=N6XyH0TkT_EsyIkko3yVGQ\" alt /></p><h2 id=\"heading-conclusion-from-the-brain-to-the-world\"><strong>Conclusion: From the Brain to the World</strong></h2><p>Ram Kumar Pari's groundbreaking research into non-invasive brain-computer interfaces, particularly his work with <strong>kTMP</strong> and new <strong>neurofeedback techniques</strong>, is unlocking the potential of neural oscillations to transform the way we interact with technology.

    "content": "<![CDATA[<h1 id=\"heading-what-redefining-ux-embracing-ai-and-design-thinking\">What: Redefining UX: Embracing AI and Design Thinking</h1><p>Alipta Ballav, Senior Design Manager at Microsoft, presented a thought-provoking shift in the UX design landscape during the BeMore Festival. The conversation centered on moving beyond the traditional \"design thinking\" methodology and adopting an AI-infused mindset that enhances how designers approach problems.</p><h2 id=\"heading-the-foundations-of-design-thinking\">The Foundations of Design Thinking</h2><p>Design thinking has been a cornerstone in the world of UX design for years, focusing on empathy, defining problems, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing. This user-centered process has been key in creating meaningful and innovative experiences for users.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2016/07/25/designthinking_illustration_final2-02.png\" alt=\"Design Thinking 101\" /></p><h2 id=\"heading-expanding-the-designers-toolkit-with-ai-thinking\">Expanding the Designer's Toolkit with AI Thinking</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727890872324/8dabacc3-f352-479c-8748-7a2b1841616d.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>Ballav believes the future of design requires an expanded perspective. This new mindset, \"AI thinking,\" involves looking at problems through a computational lens. By leveraging knowledge bases, understanding cultural nuances, and dealing with unstructured data, AI thinking allows designers to solve complex challenges with greater precision. This shift opens up new avenues for innovation, evolving beyond the confines of traditional design thinking.</p><hr /><h1 id=\"heading-why-the-need-for-a-polymath-mindset-in-ux-design\">Why: The Need for a Polymath Mindset in UX Design</h1><p>To stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry, designers need to adopt a polymath mindset. Ballav draws inspiration from historical figures like Leonardo da Vinci, who is widely regarded as a polymath due to his expertise across multiple disciplines like civil engineering, chemistry, biology, and architecture. Similarly, the future of design will require professionals who can connect the dots between diverse fields like AI, economics, social sciences, business, psychology, and UX.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727893053644/50dbaae7-6b97-4ca3-9c4f-6f41994610e4.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><h2 id=\"heading-reference-to-leonardo-da-vinci\">Reference to Leonardo da Vinci</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727893020241/1961465f-4d03-4204-83c0-fdde9b5389ed.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>Ballav cited da Vinci as an example of the polymath ideala \"comb set profile\" where individuals possess deep expertise in multiple areas. This cross-disciplinary knowledge allows designers to approach problems from different angles and create more holistic solutions. He also referenced Don Normans views, who during his visit to India, mentioned that designers should not only focus on their craft but also consider economics, politics, and other subjects to better understand the world. Even Jakob Nielson has a similar take that the future of design will be more of a generalist, here is a recap article that I had written <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.karanbalaji.com/day-27-navigating-the-future-of-ux-specialist-vs-generalist-insights-with-jakob-nielsen-sarah-gibbons\">https://blog.karanbalaji.com/day-27-navigating-the-future-of-ux-specialist-vs-generalist-insights-with-jakob-nielsen-sarah-gibbons</a></p><h2 id=\"heading-zooming-out-for-broader-context\">Zooming Out for Broader Context</h2><p>\"Design is more about zooming out and less about zooming in,\" Ballav said, stressing that UX designers need to broaden their understanding of society, culture, and technology. The ability to connect the dots across different disciplines will enable designers to craft solutions that are not only innovative but also practical and rooted in real-world dynamics. In my previous article, Don Norman has a similar take which can be read here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.karanbalaji.com/day-31-don-norman-on-designing-beyond-aesthetics-embracing-a-humanitarian-centric-and-generalist-future\">https://blog.karanbalaji.com/day-31-don-norman-on-designing-beyond-aesthetics-embracing-a-humanitarian-centric-and-generalist-future</a></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727893164381/a1d6a71d-66a4-47f0-b546-032f82da511e.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><hr /><h1 id=\"heading-how-applying-ai-thinking-in-ux-design\">How: Applying AI Thinking in UX Design</h1><p>Ballav provided real-world applications of how AI thinking can complement design thinking, particularly in improving hospital patient experiences. The screenshot below explains how it is done through design thinking lens.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727893657101/e60a1cfc-df4e-4bf4-a483-93048fc52341.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><h2 id=\"heading-through-ai-thinking-lens\">Through AI Thinking Lens:</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727893738156/dafcf889-41a8-489d-abff-801c6fb2d906.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><h3 id=\"heading-data-collection-and-analysis\">Data Collection and Analysis</h3><p>AI thinking starts with leveraging data from various sources like sensors, electronic health records, and user feedback. This data-driven approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the problem that traditional research methods might overlook.</p><h3 id=\"heading-predictive-analytics\">Predictive Analytics</h3><p>By analyzing this data, designers can predict high-traffic periods in a hospital and suggest optimal staffing levels. This anticipation reduces wait times, optimizing the patient experience.</p><h3 id=\"heading-automation-and-chatbots\">Automation and Chatbots</h3><p>AI can streamline administrative tasks, such as scheduling and billing, by automating processes and deploying chatbots for common queries. This frees up medical staff to focus on personalized care, improving overall patient satisfaction.</p><h3 id=\"heading-enhanced-patient-monitoring\">Enhanced Patient Monitoring</h3><p>AI-powered systems can monitor patients in real-time and alert staff to any critical changes, preventing complications and ensuring timely interventions.</p><hr /><h1 id=\"heading-why-ai-and-design-thinking-work-together\">Why AI and Design Thinking Work Together</h1><p>Ballav stresses that AI thinking doesnt replace design thinking but acts as a catalyst, enabling designers to harness data-driven insights alongside their human-centered expertise. The symbiotic relationship between design and AI allows for more comprehensive problem-solving.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727893961692/ef4852c3-5b50-4c5e-aa9a-c03d12147adf.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><h2 id=\"heading-the-cultural-nuances-of-common-sense\">The Cultural Nuances of Common Sense</h2><p>A key aspect of AI thinking is understanding cultural nuances and reasoning. Ballav gave an example of crossing the road to illustrate this. In countries like India, crossing the road doesnt follow the same logic as in Western cultures, where people wait for signals. Instead, people actively navigate traffic by making cars stopa behavior deeply rooted in cultural practice. This variance highlights the challenge of teaching AI to understand and respect cultural differences.</p><p>This example reminded me of Don Normans concept of cultural adaptation in design. He once shared that his kitchen design, while simple for him, would pose a challenge for anyone unfamiliar with it. Similarly, AI thinking requires designers to consider cultural reasoning when developing systems that cater to diverse backgrounds. This ability to understand multiple perspectives will help UX professionals create more personalized and inclusive experiences.</p><h2 id=\"heading-the-future-of-ux-design\">The Future of UX Design</h2><p>As the world becomes increasingly digitized, the intersection of AI and design will be crucial in developing user-centric products. Designers who embrace this AI-infused mindset will lead the charge in creating innovative solutions for the future.</p><p>By adopting AI thinking, designers can expand their capabilities and adapt to the evolving needs of users in the digital age.</p>]]>"

Guy Kawasaki, known for his podcast \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/guy-kawasakis-remarkable-people/id1483081827\">Remarkable People</a>,\" shares his journey and philosophy that inspire us to think remarkable, embrace growth, and persist with grit.</p><hr /><h4 id=\"heading-what-understanding-guy-kawasakis-journey\">What: Understanding Guy Kawasaki's Journey</h4><p><strong>A Remarkable Journey</strong></p><p>Guy Kawasaki's life is a testament to overcoming challenges with a positive outlook. Despite living with Meniere's disease, which causes hearing loss and vertigo, Guy remains humble and thankful. He grew up in a lower-middle-class family, and his parents' emphasis on education significantly shaped his path. Dropping out of law school after just two weeks, he attributes his success to the strong educational foundation his parents provided.</p><p>Growing up in Hawaii, a place rich in racial and cultural diversity, also influenced his perspective on life. The diversity of his environment taught him to appreciate different viewpoints and fostered a broader understanding of the world.</p><p><strong>Connecting the Dots</strong></p><p>Reflecting on his journey, Guy often quotes Steve Jobs: \"You can only connect the dots looking backwards.\" This perspective became clear when he saw his friends driving Porsches and Rolls Royces, motivating him to study hard and strive for success. His experience at Theranos taught him a crucial lesson: we must question authority and understand that wisdom and insight can come from anyone, regardless of their position or background.</p><p><strong>Growth Mindset and Grit</strong></p><p>Guy believes that while some people naturally possess a growth mindset, not everyone can develop it to the same extent. A growth mindset is about believing that with effort and determination, one can achieve almost anything. However, external factors and environments significantly influence this mindset.</p><p><strong>Cultivating a Growth Mindset Environment</strong></p><p>Guy emphasizes that the environment in which we are raised plays a crucial role in developing a growth mindset. In societies where failure is punished, and traditional career paths like government jobs or medicine are prioritized, individuals might feel restricted. Conversely, in environments that encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, people are more likely to adopt a growth mindset.</p><p><strong>Defining Grit</strong></p><p>Grit, according to Guy, is the ability to keep going when things are no longer easy or fun. It's about showing up consistently and persevering through challenges. Combining perseverance with grit and resilience can propel individuals to achieve their goals and continue growing, even in the face of adversity. Guy encapsulates this philosophy with the mantra: Growth, Grit, and Grace.</p><hr /><h4 id=\"heading-why-the-importance-of-growth-mindset-and-grit\">Why: The Importance of Growth Mindset and Grit</h4><p><strong>Building a Life or Career to be Proud Of</strong></p><p>For young individuals, Guy advises not to stress over making perfect decisions.

    "content": "<![CDATA[<p>For day 33 of #100DaysOfDesign, I had the privilege to speak with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronjyen/\">Aaron Yen, Marketing Manager II at Amazon on the Alexa Canada team</a>. Our conversation delved into the intricate dynamics between UX and marketing, offering valuable insights on how these two crucial domains can collaborate effectively to drive successful projects. This article provides practical advice on how UX designers can work seamlessly with marketing teams from Aaron's experiences.</p><h3 id=\"heading-the-gap\">The Gap:</h3><p><strong>What is the difference between UX and Marketing for a business strategy?</strong></p><p>UX and marketing, while seemingly at odds, are intrinsically linked. Marketing focuses on maximizing return on investment by aligning prospective customers with value, often through strategic and targeted efforts. On the other hand, UX is dedicated to creating seamless, enjoyable experiences that ensure continued product use. Without quality products, marketers cannot convert leads, and without interested leads, UX cannot serve a customer base. The synergy between these fields is essential for a holistic business strategy.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: When Bell designed the touchtone telephone, they tested three designs, choosing the fastest one with the lowest error rate. This decision, driven by empirical data, set a new norm in telecommunications.</p><h4 id=\"heading-why-is-business-design-important\">Why is Business Design Important?</h4><p>Aaron explains business design and UX design are crucial for creating products and services that not only delight users but also achieve business objectives. Business design focuses on integrating design thinking into strategic planning, ensuring solutions are economically viable and aligned with market needs. UX design, on the other hand, prioritizes the user's experience, making products intuitive and enjoyable through rigorous research and testing. The intersection of these disciplines ensures that user-centered designs also support business growth and innovation, leading to solutions that are both effective and sustainable. Together, they create a synergy that drives successful and impactful product development.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/-/media/Images/Programs-and-Areas/BDI/BD-Method---4-steps.jpg?h=265&amp;w=723&amp;la=en&amp;hash=0C0A0B6EE51704F404305B0ABA4A08A8066AA90F\" alt=\"Click here to view a hi-res version\" /></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/EducationCentres/BusinessDesignInitiative\">Source: Rotman</a></p><p><strong>How do UX and Marketing fit into Business Design for a company?</strong></p><p>Business design integrates product development into broader business contexts, iterating on revenue models, operations, strategies, and technologies. UX and marketing apply customer-centric focuses from different angles, both benefiting from prototyping and iterative testing. This approach allows companies to balance financial influx with necessary updates, driving innovation and growth.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: Business design at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management involves applying product development principles to business operations, strategy, and technology, allowing for rapid adaptation and growth.</p><h3 id=\"heading-practical-collaboration-tips\">Practical Collaboration Tips</h3><p><strong>What are some practical tips for UX designers to improve their collaboration with marketing teams? Are there specific tools or processes you recommend?</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Skill Development for UX Designers</strong>: UX designers should develop a T-shaped skillset, integrating marketing knowledge. Follow vocal industry professionals on LinkedIn for the latest trends and strategies. This approach helps UX designers understand the broader context of their work and how it aligns with marketing goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Effective Communication and Collaboration</strong>: Strategies for effective communication include aligning on goals and metrics. Consult finance teams to prioritize key business metrics, then map these to pre-sale (marketing) and post-sale (UX) stages. Regular meetings and collaborative tools like Slack, Trello, or Asana can facilitate better communication and project management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aligning Goals and Metrics</strong>: Use a northstar scorecard to highlight business priorities. For example, if brand awareness is a key metric, UX designers can create experiences that enhance engagement and reach. Aligning on a few key metrics helps both teams focus on what matters most for business success.</p></li><li><p><strong>User Research Integration</strong>: Integrate UX user research into marketing strategies to create a cohesive user journey. Understand customer appeal at each stage to build a complete business strategy. Sharing user research findings with marketing teams can inform campaign strategies and help tailor messages to customer needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maintaining Design Consistency</strong>: Ensure consistency in design and brand voice across UX and marketing efforts. UX teams can contribute by adhering to brand guidelines and creating experiences that align with the overall brand message. Regular reviews and collaborative workshops can ensure that both teams are on the same page.</p></li></ol><h3 id=\"heading-context-of-marketing-for-ux-roles\">Context of Marketing for UX Roles</h3><p><strong>What are the levels of marketing from startup to mid-sized to enterprise?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Startup Marketing</strong>: Startup marketing is narrow. Its quick and focused towards generating outcomes from targeted customers, often with the intention to drive conversion, with an emphasis on UX driving the quality of uniquely differentiating or best-in-class product experiences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mid-sized Marketing</strong>: Strategies from individual contributors and/or managers revolve around growth-oriented development and product trends. There is a balance of relationship building among customers through a sustained middle-funnel of consideration campaigns, where UX can be segmented into prime-focused features and premium offerings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enterprise Marketing</strong>: Strategies are highly affected by reputation through partnerships, awareness to gain market share among large segments, and customer value that is value-based and revenue-driven. UX has a role here in applying experiences that support the brand, while changing aspects of customization that relate to bigger-picture influences, like thematic or sales calendars.</p></li></ul><h3 id=\"heading-skill-development-for-ux-designers\">Skill Development for UX Designers</h3><p><strong>What skills or knowledge should UX designers develop to better understand and support marketing efforts? How can they stay informed about the latest marketing trends and strategies?</strong></p><p>Just like how marketers should be T-shaped in their skillset, where a deep foundation into a specific aspect should be supplemented with arms that broadly reach a variety of areas, UX designers can adopt marketing as one of the arms. My best tip for understanding the latest marketing trends is to target vocal LinkedIn profiles in industries and companies that are of interest. Just following marketing or product managers who love to showcase their work can turn LinkedIn into a faster news outlet than people can catch on, because posts come from the direct source - the people who built those things.</p><h4 id=\"heading-effective-communication-and-collaboration\">Effective Communication and Collaboration</h4><p><strong>Can you share strategies/tips for ensuring effective communication and collaboration between UX and marketing teams? What are some examples of successful projects where these departments worked well together?</strong></p><p>Aligning goals and metrics between UX and marketing teams is crucial. By creating a simple, short-listed northstar scorecard that highlights the barebones impact of the business priorities, both teams can ensure they are working towards a common objective. Understanding the financial aspects of business, as well as customer engagement metrics, helps in creating a unified approach.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: At Amazon, aligning the goals of the Alexa marketing and UX teams involved regular collaborative sessions to review customer feedback and marketing performance, ensuring a cohesive strategy that enhanced both user experience and market reach.</p><h4 id=\"heading-aligning-goals-and-metrics\">Aligning Goals and Metrics</h4><p><strong>How can UX and marketing teams align their goals and success metrics to ensure they are working towards a common objective? What are some practical steps to achieve this alignment?</strong></p><p>The best process to reach an alignment is to consult finance teams on their KPIs for monetization and revenue-generating aspects of the business first. From there, prioritize 3-5 singular metrics that can describe business position and growth towards a financial perspective, and then ladder into pre-and-post sale (pre-sale for marketing, post-sale for UX).</p><h4 id=\"heading-user-research-integration\">User Research Integration</h4><p><strong>How can user research conducted by UX teams be effectively integrated into marketing strategies? Could you share an example of how user insights have positively influenced a marketing campaign?</strong></p><p>Marketing and UX are at opposite ends of a customer journey spectrum. Marketing is about creating and generating leads before a customer purchases a product, and design is about keeping customers engaged with the experience of the product. Both are dependent on each other for a full user journey, and understanding what appeals to customers at each stage is crucial for building business.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: At Amazon, user research insights about voice assistant preferences were integrated into Alexa's marketing strategies, highlighting features that resonated most with users, thereby increasing user engagement and sales.</p><h4 id=\"heading-maintaining-design-consistency\">Maintaining Design Consistency</h4><p><strong>What are the best practices for maintaining design consistency and brand voice across UX and marketing efforts? How can UX teams contribute to ensuring a cohesive brand experience?</strong></p><p>Maintaining design consistency involves regular communication and collaboration between UX and marketing teams. UX teams can ensure a cohesive brand experience by adhering to brand guidelines and creating user interfaces that reflect the brands voice and values. Regular design reviews and collaborative workshops can help both teams stay aligned.</p><h3 id=\"heading-top-tips-for-ux-professionals\">Top Tips for UX Professionals</h3><p><strong>What advice would you give to UX professionals to better understand and collaborate with marketing teams? How can UX designers play a significant role in developing and enhancing marketing strategies?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ask Good Questions</strong>: Engage deeply in the product development lifecycle to understand marketing needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stay Updated</strong>: Follow trends in marketing, such as AI-driven campaign customization, to find parallels with UX design.</p></li><li><p><strong>Align Goals</strong>: Work closely with marketing to align on key metrics and objectives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaborate Regularly</strong>: Hold regular meetings and workshops to ensure ongoing collaboration and alignment.</p></li></ul><h4 id=\"heading-marketing-focused-topics\">Marketing-Focused Topics</h4><p><strong>What are the latest trends in the marketing world with regards to creative development that could be similar to UX?</strong></p><p>Similarly to UX design, marketing leverages AI to expedite and mass-release campaigns for products. Customizing experiences for target audiences via prompt engineering has allowed traditionally tedious aspects of marketing, like multicultural tailoring or localization, to shift into more strategic focuses for marketing, where managers now need to think less about executing and more on wider outreach or partnerships.</p><h4 id=\"heading-challenge\">Challenge</h4><p><strong>Marketing and UX are at opposite ends of a customer journey spectrum. As a marketer who has not seen the product, they develop a funnel to highlight the value of the product. How do we take the budget or reputation we have and add as much value as we can to ensure a seamless customer experience?</strong></p><h3 id=\"heading-join-the-conversation\">Join the Conversation</h3><p>Join our #100DaysOfDesign Discord channel to discuss more on this topic anonymously and share your events and perspectives to continuously learn: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.gg/emkkRvTRTR\">https://discord.gg/emkkRvTRTR</a>.</p>]]>"

By adopting a holistic, interdisciplinary approach and focusing on humanitarian outcomes, designers can address the root causes of global challenges. Norman's vision extends beyond traditional design thinking, advocating for a world where design is a catalyst for positive change, balancing human needs with the health of our planet and society.</p><p>As we reflect on Norman's insights, it becomes evident that the future of design lies in our ability to adapt, learn, and apply our skills towards creating sustainable, ethical, and universally beneficial solutions. The path forward is not just about aesthetics or usability; it's about leveraging design as a powerful tool for social and environmental stewardship.</p><h2 id=\"heading-my-question-to-don-norman\">My Question To Don Norman</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710801910952/e70fafa0-6de3-465e-b2cd-b3d32b298c93.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>In a thrilling exchange during the fireside chat with Don Norman, I had the opportunity to ask a question that delves deep into the intersection of design and other disciplines. My inquiry was, 'Considering coding, psychology, anthropology, cognitive neuroscience, and behavioral economics, which do you believe would most effectively complement my design skills, or is there another area you'd suggest?'</p><p>A huge thank you to everyone who voted for my question, which Don Norman elaborated on during his talk. He emphasized the importance of learning about people not only through disciplines like anthropology and psychology but also from novelists who observe and write about the simple, everyday aspects of human behaviour, such as why people scratch or dance.</p><p>This interaction was a highlight for me, spotlighting the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge in pushing the boundaries of design thinking.</p><h2 id=\"heading-meme-the-matrix-of-design\">(Meme) The Matrix of Design</h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710800054627/b6d2d19d-5ce5-4006-b9dd-0659a736d203.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>In a moment of profound realization, Don Norman gazes out his window and observes a world entirely crafted by human hands. This epiphany highlights the artificial nature of our surroundings, underscoring the pivotal role of design in shaping our reality. This reflection leads Norman to delve deeper into history, seeking the roots of design principles that have guided human innovation over centuries.</p><p>This journey of discovery echoes the iconic scene from \"The Matrix,\" where the protagonist is offered a choice between the red pill and the blue pilla decision between embracing the harsh truths of reality or remaining in the comfort of blissful ignorance. Norman's moment of realization is akin to choosing the red pill, embarking on a quest to understand the historical and artificial constructs of our world.</p><p>Through this lens, Norman posits that the essence of design lies not just in the creation of aesthetically pleasing or functional objects but in the profound understanding of humanity's history and artificial constructs. This perspective challenges us to think beyond the surface, urging designers to consider the broader implications of their work on society and the environment.</p><p>By weaving together the threads of history, human behavior, and design, Norman invites us to view our role as designers in a new light. We are not just creators of objects or experiences but architects of the future, with the power to shape the world in ways that resonate with the deepest aspects of human existence.</p><p>As we ponder Norman's insights, we are reminded of the power of design to transcend the artificial, to question the status quo, and to forge a path towards a more thoughtful, humanitarian-centric future. In this \"Matrix\" of design, every decision, every creation, has the potential to redefine our world and our place within it.</p><p>Join the conversation and explore how we can all contribute to a better world through design. #DesignForABetterWorld #HumanitarianDesign #DonNorman #FutureOfDesign</p>]]>"

This strategic alignment not only demonstrates the tangible impact of design decisions but also ensures these decisions are measurable and directly contribute to business success. A prime example Friedman showcases to illustrate this concept involves a multi-tiered approach to KPIs, which bridges the gap between business metrics and design initiatives:</p><ul><li><ul><li><p><strong>Business KPI:</strong> Referral Rate - A key performance indicator that tracks the effectiveness of users referring others to the product.</p><p>    * <strong>Design KPI:</strong> Average Recommendation per User in a Month - This metric delves deeper into the user behavior, specifically focusing on how design influences the likelihood of recommendations.</p><p>    * <strong>Measure:</strong> Percentage of Users Who Have Referred at Least 1 Person to Our Products Over the Last 6 Months - This measure provides a clear, quantifiable insight into referral rates over a significant period, offering a direct link to the effectiveness of design strategies.</p><p>    * <strong>Design Initiative:</strong> Improve Branding Perception by Featuring Successful Case Studies - This actionable initiative aims to enhance the product's branding perception, thereby increasing referral rates. By showcasing successful case studies, the design directly contributes to a positive brand image, encouraging more users to make referrals.</p><p>    This example perfectly encapsulates how design KPIs can be meticulously mapped to business KPIs, ensuring that every design initiative is not only aligned with but actively contributes to the overarching business goals. Through such strategic alignment, design transcends its traditional boundaries, becoming a pivotal driver of business success</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=\"heading-how-implementing-friedmans-visionary-strategies\"><strong>(How) Implementing Friedman's Visionary Strategies</strong></h2><h3 id=\"heading-building-and-nurturing-relationships\"><strong>Building and Nurturing Relationships</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Proactive Relationship Building:</strong> Seeking opportunities for meaningful connections and being accessible for collaboration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creating a Supportive Community:</strong> The importance of a dynamic and supportive design community.</p></li></ul><h3 id=\"heading-decoding-the-dialogue-the-contrast-between-business-and-ux-language-in-design-strategy\">Decoding the Dialogue: The Contrast Between Business and UX Language in Design Strategy</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709170542417/60174a8e-0201-48da-91fe-225e2d10c54c.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>In this insightful snapshot from a Fireside Chat with Vitaly Friedman, we're presented with a compelling comparison between Business language and UX language. The image highlights how the vocabulary we choose can significantly impact our approach to design and user experience. On one side, we see Business language with aggressive terms such as \"Conquer,\" \"Capture,\" and \"Destroy,\" which reflect a combative and market-driven focus. On the flip side, UX language uses nurturing terms like \"Reduce friction,\" \"Empower users,\" and \"Develop empathy,\" indicating a more user-centered approach that aims to create an inclusive and supportive customer experience.
