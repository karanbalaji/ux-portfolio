          Born out of NEXT AI and my experience boosting my fintech AI Voice Agent project, FintechToronto.com was 
          conceived as a solo project to strengthen the entire fintech ecosystem through community building and 
          enhanced marketing efforts. This platform addresses a critical gap in Toronto&apos;s fintech landscape by 
          providing a centralized, user-friendly hub that connects professionals, entrepreneurs, investors, and 
          enthusiasts while building relevance and community engagement across the ecosystem.
